### Review Feedback and Action Plan:

#### Dataset Concerns:
- **R1P1: Practicality and Real-world Alignment**
  - Concern: Skepticism about the real-world relevance of the proposed datasets, especially regarding mixed exposure conditions.
  - **Suggestion**: Reevaluate and provide a detailed rationale behind the design of the datasets. Showcase real-world scenarios where such datasets are applicable.
  
- **R2P2: Boundary Artifacts and Copyright**
  - Concern: The need to analyze boundary artifacts in the new datasets and potential copyright issues for modifying existing ones.
  - **Suggestion**: Analyze and document potential boundary artifacts. Check permissions and explicitly mention any permissions obtained or necessary credit given for modifying existing datasets.
  
- **R1P5 & R3P1: Night Wenzhou Dataset Improvements**
  - Concern: Enhance the Night Wenzhou dataset with normal light videos. Address concerns about its real-world relevance and the absence of reference labels.
  - **Suggestion**: Consider including normal light videos for a more comprehensive dataset. Address the design decisions behind the dataset and its relevance.
  
#### Methodology & Literature:
- **R2P1: Traditional Learning Categorization**
  - Concern: Non-orthogonal categorizations in traditional learning methodologies.
  - **Suggestion**: Rethink and restructure the categorization to ensure clarity and correctness. Avoid overlapping categorizations.

- **R2P3 & R5P1: Inclusion of Additional Methods**
  - Concern: Inclusion of more representative methods and models, especially those based on NIR light.
  - **Suggestion**: Update the literature review section to incorporate mentioned methods and models. Discuss their relevance and how they fit within the broader narrative.

- **R3P2: Noise Distribution Modeling**
  - Concern: Consider the modeling of noise distribution in dark environments.
  - **Suggestion**: Delve into recent works focusing on noise distribution modeling in dark settings. Discuss their methodologies and findings.

#### Presentation & Writing:
- **R1P2, R2P4, R5P3: Figure Clarity**
  - Concern: Several figures (like Fig.16, Fig.15, Fig.5, and Fig.6) lack clarity or are direct copies from source papers.
  - **Suggestion**: Revise figures to enhance clarity. Consider creating original diagrams or illustrations where appropriate. Avoid direct copying.

- **R1P7, R2P5, R3P5: Manuscript Quality**
  - Concern: Grammatical errors, typos, and general manuscript polish.
  - **Suggestion**: Conduct a thorough proofreading. Consider using professional editing services or grammar-checking tools.

- **R5P6: Differentiation from Existing Surveys**
  - Concern: The need for stronger differentiation from existing survey papers.
  - **Suggestion**: Highlight unique contributions and takeaways. Emphasize what sets this work apart from previous surveys in the field.

#### Additional Feedback:
- **R1P3: Image vs. Video Enhancement**
  - Concern: The paper doesn't adequately separate the discussion of low-light image and video enhancement.
  - **Suggestion**: Clearly delineate sections discussing image enhancement from those discussing video enhancement. Highlight key differences and challenges.

- **R1P4: Potential Solutions Discussion**
  - Concern: The absence of discussion on potential solutions to observed shortcomings of current low-light methods.
  - **Suggestion**: Delve into potential solutions or advancements that could address the identified shortcomings in current methods.

- **R3P4: Dataset Clarity for Models**
  - Concern: Clarify on which dataset certain models are trained for a fair comparison.
  - **Suggestion**: Clearly label or categorize models based on their training datasets. Consider retraining some for direct comparisons.

- **R4P1 & R4P2: Clarity and Thorough Analysis**
  - Concern: Desire for clarity in explanations and thorough analysis.
  - **Suggestion**: Expand on sections that seem condensed. Ensure all key concepts are well-explained and supported by evidence or examples.
