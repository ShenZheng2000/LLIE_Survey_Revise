- Dataset Concerns:
  - [R1P1] Skepticism about the practicality and real-world alignment of the proposed datasets, especially regarding mixed exposure conditions.
  - [R2P2] The need to analyze boundary artifacts in the new datasets and potential copyright issues for modifying existing ones.
  - [R1P5] Suggestions to enhance the Night Wenzhou dataset with normal light videos for better relevance.
  - [R3P1] Concerns about the proposed datasets not aligning with real scenarios and lacking corresponding references/labels.

- Methodology & Literature:
  - [R2P1] Clarification sought on non-orthogonal categorizations in traditional learning and the need for better categorization.
  - [R2P3] A call for the inclusion of more representative methods and models for comprehensive analysis.
  - [R5P1] Missing discussions on works based on NIR light.
  - [R3P2] The necessity to consider modeling of noise distribution in dark environments.

- Presentation & Writing:
  - [R1P2][R2P4] Several figures (like Fig.16, Fig.15, Fig.5, and Fig.6) were flagged for clarity.
  - [R5P3] Advisement against copying framework figures directly from original papers.
  - [R1P7][R2P5][R3P5] Grammatical errors, typos, and general manuscript polish were frequently highlighted.
  - [R5P6] A stronger need for differentiation from existing surveys.

- Additional Feedback:
  - [R1P3] The paper seemingly doesn't adequately separate the discussion of low-light image and video enhancement.
  - [R1P4] Calls for discussion on potential solutions to the observed shortcomings of current low-light methods.
  - [R3P4] Emphasis on clarifying which dataset certain models are trained on for a fair comparison.
  - [R4P1][R4P2] A desire for clarity in explanations, thorough analysis, and improvement in presentation quality.
