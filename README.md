- Dataset Concerns:
  - Skepticism about the practicality and real-world alignment of the proposed datasets, especially regarding mixed exposure conditions.
  - The need to analyze boundary artifacts in the new datasets and potential copyright issues for modifying existing ones.
  - Suggestions to enhance the Night Wenzhou dataset with normal light videos for better relevance.
  - Concerns about the proposed datasets not aligning with real scenarios and lacking corresponding references/labels.

- Methodology & Literature:
  - Clarification sought on non-orthogonal categorizations in traditional learning and the need for better categorization.
  - A call for the inclusion of more representative methods and models for comprehensive analysis.
  - Missing discussions on works based on NIR light and modeling of noise distribution in dark environments.
  - The necessity to consider low-light image enhancement in higher-level application scenarios.

- Presentation & Writing:
  - Several figures (like Fig.16, Fig.15, Fig.5, and Fig.6) were flagged for clarity, and there were suggestions to replace some figures with tables.
  - Advisement against copying framework figures directly from original papers.
  - Grammatical errors, typos, and general manuscript polish were frequently highlighted.
  - A stronger need for differentiation from existing surveys.

- Additional Feedback:
  - The paper seemingly doesn't adequately separate the discussion of low-light image and video enhancement.
  - Calls for discussion on potential solutions to the observed shortcomings of current low-light methods.
  - Emphasis on clarifying which dataset certain models are trained on for a fair comparison.
  - A desire for clarity in explanations, thorough analysis, and improvement in presentation quality.
